## Project Goals
This goal of this project is to create a scalable messaging application similar to that of Whatsapp.

## Framework
This project uses Vue.js to control the client and server. For now, the server handles data on-site and does not reach to a cloud-based storage facility, but this is scheduled to be updated.

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
