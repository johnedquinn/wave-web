## Project Goals
This goal of this project is to create a scalable messaging application similar to that of Whatsapp.

## Framework
### Frontend
This project uses Node.js and Vue.js to create a responsive frontend.

### Backend
This project uses PHP to control the backend.

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

## Takebacks
- This project was a great introduction to PHP and Vue.js. I learned a lot about reactive components and how PHP links with SQL tables. The project is fully functional.
